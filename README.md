# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis

A data analytics and machine learning project that explores customer churn — analyzing why customers leave a business and building models to predict churn using real data.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Customer churn refers to when customers stop using a service or product. This project aims to:

- Understand patterns and trends in customer behavior
- Explore the factors that influence churn
- Build predictive models to identify customers who are likely to churn

By analyzing churn, businesses can improve customer retention strategies and reduce revenue loss.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as:

- Customer demographics (e.g., age, gender)
- Account information (tenure, services subscribed)
- Usage behavior
- Target variable indicating whether the customer churned

This data helps identify patterns in customer retention and churn.
